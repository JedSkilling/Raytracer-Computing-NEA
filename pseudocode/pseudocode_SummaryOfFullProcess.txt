FOREACH pixel IN screen
    Create several new ray objects of slightly different directions     A
    FOREACH ray IN currentPixelRays
        WHILE ray has not hit a light source
            FindIntersection                                            B
            Find new direction                                          C
            Calculate effect on colour                                  D
        END WHILE
        Calculate final ray colour
	END FOREACH
    Take the average of each colour every ray returned
    Display that colour to the screen at that pixel coordinate
