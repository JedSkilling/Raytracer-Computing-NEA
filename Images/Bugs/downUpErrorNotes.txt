When testing for the correct directions of up and down I ran into a problem.
By setting each pixel colour to the z co-ordinate of the vector (dot product with the unit z vector)
the lighter parts of the screen looked as though they were below the camera.

Pressing the up arrow to move up also made it look as though the camera was turning down.
The issue was that winforms and bitmaps treat y = 0 as the top of the image wereas i treated it as the bottom
