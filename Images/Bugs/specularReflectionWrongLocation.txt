Specular reflection was always headed back towards the camera:
(2023.10.10.20.33_RayTracer_635, 2023.10.10.19.51_RayTracer_564)
Even though the light source is above the camera, the light appears
to come from behind the camera. The specular reflection patch should be nearer the
top of the sphere on the green ball in each case.

FIXED
Problem was BRDF getting inputted the wrong rays, it wanted the input and output rays
in the physical sense, not the order in which we calculate them in the program.
